Personal portfolio website. Check it out: 

This website is enitrely written in Rust, using the [leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos) webassembly framework, with [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for css.

This a little challenge I gave myself to build a frontend in something other than javascript.
